# electron-demo
WIP Electron API Demo App in Electron. META.

## What

This is an Electron app that provides documentation and interaction with the Electron API. See this [existing project](https://github.com/craigshoemaker/electron-api-demos) for an idea of what this means. 

## Goals

Next-level documentation that helps developers build Electron apps.

This will demonstrate how to use the API and can be used to see the API in action on each platform. It will also serve to be a demonstration of basic Electron app structure and best practices. 

**Follow along in the [issues](https://github.com/atom/electron-demo).**
