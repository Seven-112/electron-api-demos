# electron-api-demos

This is a desktop app that interactively and with sample code demonstrates core features of the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) API. It's built with Electron, too, of course. This app works on Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems.

Use this app to see what you can do with Electron and use the source code to learn how to create a basic Electron app.
